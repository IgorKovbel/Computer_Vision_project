# About The Project


The task is to analyze the images of the tic-tac-toe game, find the winner and draw the line that crosses the row of 3 marks (X or O). 

#### Deliverable: 

* Working code (it should be possible to install all the necessary packages to run it from requirements.txt using pip).
* A short report [in English] on the principle of operation of your solution (better with some illustrations).
* The initial game images with the line that crosses the straight line of 3 same marks.

## Navigate

* <b>main.py</b> - This file goes through all the images from the task and forms the result in the folder <b>results</b>.
* <b>Tic_tac_toe_game_analysis.ipynb</b> - A short report on the principle of operation of my solution with a bit of code and explanations.
* <b>workflow.ipynb</b> - Notebook on which I worked and experimented.
* <b>my_funcs.py</b> - All the functions I wrote while working for the final result.


## My talk

I managed to solve this problem, but I want to note a few disadvantages of my project. First, I don't know if it will work on other data. Also, in my opinion, I still have not enough experience, and because of this, perhaps the project has not the best or optimal solution. But I want to say that this project gave me some experience and understanding of how to develop further.
